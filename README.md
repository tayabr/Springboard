Southern Water Corp is a fictional water desalination plant. In this case study, you will be dealing with minute by minute time-series data. The data will be recorded every minute for a number of variables like temperature. In particular, you will use each of the descriptive techniques you learned and reinforce this with analyzing the behavior of a desalination plant pump before failure and during failure. If Southern Water Corp can proactively identify pumps performing abnormally they will likely be able to reduce their maintenance costs. More importantly, having an alert in place will save the engineers time. This means they can let the system analyze failures on their behalf as opposed to them always looking at the signal(s) themselves. If you are able to do this reliably, SWC can reduce the overall production costs and improve the overall market economics which will become a business advantage. We previously used Microsoft Excel's data analytics capabilities to analyze Southern Water Corp's Pump Data. While Excel is powerful, it was a bit tricky to use for visualizations like box plots, multiple line plots and, in general, there are challenges that arise when doing quick analysis. In this Case Study, you're going to revisit the Pump Data, with a few different questions that help you see how you can use Python to speed up your analysis.
